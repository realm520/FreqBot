# PRD: Support XT.com Exchange API

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the integration of XT.com exchange API into the FreqBot quantitative trading platform. XT.com is a global cryptocurrency exchange offering spot and futures trading with deep liquidity across 500+ trading pairs. This integration will expand FreqBot's exchange coverage, providing users with access to XT.com's unique trading pairs and competitive fee structure, ultimately increasing the platform's market reach and trading opportunities.

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation
FreqBot currently supports major exchanges through the FreqTrade framework, but lacks integration with XT.com, which has been growing rapidly in the Asian and emerging markets. Users have requested XT.com support for:
- Access to unique altcoin pairs not available on other exchanges
- Lower trading fees for high-volume traders
- Regional market advantages in Asia-Pacific
- Diverse liquidity pools and arbitrage opportunities

### Why Now?
- XT.com has reached top 20 in global exchange rankings by volume
- Increasing user demand from Asian markets (30% of our user base)
- Competitive advantage as few trading bots currently support XT.com
- API stability has improved significantly in recent updates (v4 release)

- WebSocket connection limit: 100 subscriptions per connection
- Maximum order size limits per market
- API maintenance windows (typically Sunday 2-4 AM UTC)

### Resource Constraints
- Development effort: 2-3 developers for 4 weeks
- Testing resources: Access to XT.com testnet
- Documentation translation (API docs primarily in Chinese)

### Assumptions
- XT.com API v4 remains stable during development
- FreqTrade framework supports custom exchange adapters
- XT.com provides sandbox environment for testing
- No major regulatory changes affecting XT.com operations

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly NOT included in this phase:

- ‚ùå XT.com futures/derivatives trading (spot only initially)
- ‚ùå Margin trading and lending features
- ‚ùå XT.com staking and earn products
- ‚ùå Fiat deposit/withdrawal operations
- ‚ùå Copy trading functionality
- ‚ùå XT.com mobile app integration
